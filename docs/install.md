# Install Espframe on a Guition ESP32-P4 Display

Flash Espframe to a supported Guition ESP32-P4 display from your browser — no desktop toolchain or ESPHome required.

## What You'll Need

- **Supported Guition ESP32-P4 display**, **USB-C data cable** (not a charge-only cable), **Immich server** on your network ([immich.app](https://immich.app/)), and an [**Immich API key**](./api-key)

| Model | Panel | Stand |
|-------|-------|-------|
| Guition ESP32-P4 10" `JC8012P4A1` | [AliExpress](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_c4LLo3rH) | [MakerWorld](https://makerworld.com/en/models/2490049-guition-p4-10inch-screen-stand#profileId-2736046) |

## Connect the Display

The device has two USB-C ports. Plug the cable into the **bottom port** (labeled **USB** on the PCB) — the one closest to the edge, next to the USB-A connector. The upper port is for the screen ribbon cable only.

::: tip Wrong port?
If flashing fails, make sure you're using the **bottom** USB-C port as shown above. The upper port will not work for flashing.

## Web Installer

Connect the display via USB-C, then click the install button below. Check the model printed in the listing or on the PCB before continuing.

::: info Browser
Requires **Chrome** or **Edge** on a desktop computer with [Web Serial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Serial_API). Safari and Firefox not supported.

## Steps

1. **Connect** — Plug in with USB-C; allow drivers if prompted.
2. **Flash** — Click **Install Espframe for Immich**, choose the device’s serial port, confirm. Takes a few minutes.
3. **WiFi** — Enter network name and password when prompted. If no prompt appears, the device creates a hotspot named **immich-frame-10inch**; connect from phone/laptop for captive-portal setup.
4. **Immich** — Open the device IP in a browser (shown on screen), enter **Immich Server URL** and **API Key**. The URL can be an IP address such as `http://192.168.1.30:2283` or a domain such as `https://photos.example.com`. See [API Key](/api-key) for permissions. Photos start loading. Next: [Photo Sources](/photo-sources) to choose what to display.

The setup wizard defaults to **24 Hour** clock format, **Europe/London (GMT+0)** timezone, shows the clock by default, and uses **0.pool.ntp.org**, **1.pool.ntp.org**, and **2.pool.ntp.org** for time sync. Pick your timezone during setup so the clock and sunrise/sunset based brightness and night tone are calculated for your location. The on-screen clock refreshes every **60 seconds**.

## Recent firmware notes

- **Multiple Person or Album IDs:** Saving comma-separated UUID lists uses a POST body so long lists no longer hit **414 URI Too Long**. Album IDs and Person IDs are still limited to **255 characters** each; see [Photo Sources](/photo-sources#album-and-person-id-limits).
- **Photo date filters:** The web UI now supports fixed date ranges and rolling ranges such as the last 6 months or last 2 years. See [Photo Sources](/photo-sources#date-filtering).
- **ESPHome 2026.5:** Current local builds use ESPHome `2026.5.0`; manual builds also include compatibility fixes for ESPHome 2026.3 and 2026.4 LVGL changes.
