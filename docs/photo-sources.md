# Espframe Photo Sources for Immich

Choose the **Source** in the device web UI at `http://<device-ip>/` under **Photo Source**. Changes apply automatically shortly after you change a control.

| Source | Extra setup | Best for |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| **All Photos** | None | Whole library |
| **Favorites** | Mark favorites in Immich | Curated highlights |
| **Album** | One or more album UUIDs | Specific albums |
| **Person** | One or more person UUIDs | Photos of specific people |
| **Memories** | None | "On this day" from past years |

---

## All Photos

Shows photos sampled across your entire Immich library. Set **Source** to **All Photos**; leave Albums and People empty.

## Favorites

Shows only photos marked with the heart in Immich, sampled across the full favorites list. Set **Source** to **Favorites**. Ensure at least some photos are favorited.

## Album

Shows photos from one or more Immich albums. **Get the UUID:** open the album in Immich — the URL is `.../albums/<uuid>`. Paste one UUID into **Albums**, then optionally add a short description in **What is it?**. Use **Add an album** to add another album if needed.

The descriptions are saved with the IDs so the web UI can show friendly labels later. They do not affect which photos Immich returns.

Album photos are sampled through paged Immich search, so large albums are not limited to the first small batch of results.

## Person

Shows photos where specific people (faces) appear. Requires face recognition in Immich. **Get the UUID:** open the person under **People** — the URL is `.../person/<uuid>`. Paste one UUID into **People**, then optionally add the person's name in **Who is it?**. Use **Add a person** to add another person if needed. With several IDs, each new image is chosen from **one** of those people at random, so you see photos featuring **any** of them (not only photos where everyone appears together). Your [API key](/api-key) needs `person.read`.

The names are saved with the IDs so the web UI can show friendly labels later. They do not need to match the name stored in Immich.

Person photos are sampled through paged Immich search, so large libraries are not limited to the first small batch of results.

## Album and Person ID limits

The device stores each of **Album IDs**, **Album Labels**, **Person IDs**, and **Person Labels** as a single text field with a **255 character** maximum. For IDs, that is about six full UUIDs plus commas. The web UI blocks longer lists and shows an error so values are not silently cut short.

Saving multiple IDs uses an HTTP POST body for the value, so the request stays within URL length limits and avoids errors such as **414 URI Too Long**.

## Memories

Shows "On this day" photos from past years, including two days before and two days after today's date; falls back to random if none. Set **Source** to **Memories**. No IDs needed. API key needs **memory.read**. Set **Timezone** (Clock) correctly so "today" matches.

## Date Filtering

Use **Advanced Filters** in the web UI to limit photos by when they were taken. You can use either fixed dates, such as a specific holiday range, or a rolling range, such as the last 6 months.

Date filter changes save automatically shortly after you change a control. You do not need to click an Apply button.

| Setting | Default | Format | Description |
|---------|---------|--------|-------------|
| **Filter by Date** | Off | Toggle | Turns date filtering on or off. When off, saved date values are ignored. |
| **Mode** | `Fixed Range` | Select | Choose whether to use fixed dates or a relative range ending today. |
| **From** | *(empty)* | `YYYY-MM-DD` | In fixed mode, only show photos taken on or after this date. Leave empty for no lower bound. |
| **Until** | *(empty)* | `YYYY-MM-DD` | In fixed mode, only show photos taken on or before this date. Leave empty for no upper bound. |
| **Last** | `1` | Number | In relative mode, the amount of time to include. |
| **Unit** | `Years` | `Months` or `Years` | In relative mode, whether the amount is counted in months or years. |

Fixed mode and relative mode are mutually exclusive, so relative ranges do not combine with the fixed From or Until dates.

### Fixed Range

Use **Fixed Range** when you want a specific window of time. For example:

- Set **From** to `2024-12-01` and **Until** to `2024-12-31` to show photos taken during December 2024.
- Leave **From** empty and set **Until** to `2020-12-31` to show photos taken up to the end of 2020.
- Set **From** to `2023-01-01` and leave **Until** empty to show photos from 2023 onwards.

### Relative Range

Use **Relative Range** when you want the filter to move forward automatically over time. Set **Last** to a number and choose **Months** or **Years**.

Examples:

- **Last** `6`, **Unit** `Months` shows photos from the last 6 months.
- **Last** `1`, **Unit** `Years` shows photos from the last year.
- **Last** `2`, **Unit** `Years` shows photos from the last 2 years.

The relative range ends on today, using the frame's configured time. Set **Timezone** under **Clock** so "today" matches your local day.

::: tip
Use relative mode for ranges like the last 6 months, last 1 year, or last 2 years so the lower bound moves forward automatically.

## Layout

Use **Layout** to control how photos are chosen and fitted to the screen.

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| **Portrait Pairing** | On | Pairs compatible portrait photos side-by-side on landscape screens. |
| **Photo Orientation** | Any | Choose any photo, portrait-only photos, or landscape-only photos. Portrait-only is useful when the frame is mounted vertically. |
| **Display Mode** | Fill | Fill crops to cover the screen; Fit letterboxes without cropping. |

---

## Metadata

Use **Metadata** in the **Immich** section of the web UI to control the photo information shown over the current image.

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| **Location** | On | Shows the photo location when Immich has location data for the image. |
| **Date** | On | Shows the photo date. |
| **Date Format** | Date Taken | Choose whether the date uses the photo's taken date or a relative age. |
| **Date Taken Format** | `1 January, 2026` | Choose the display style used when **Date Format** is set to **Date Taken**. |

## Frequency

**Slideshow Interval** (under **Frequency** in the web UI) sets how long each photo is shown before advancing (default 15 seconds, range 10 seconds to 10 minutes).

**Connection Timeout** sets how long the frame waits without successfully displaying a new photo before showing the connection-failed screen (default 10 minutes, range 30 seconds – 30 minutes). Increase this if you have a slow server or large photo library and see false disconnects.
