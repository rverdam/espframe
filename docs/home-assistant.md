# Espframe Home Assistant Integration

Home Assistant is **not required** — the frame works standalone. If you run [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/), you can add it as an ESPHome device for updates and dashboard control.

## Adding the Device

Espframe runs on [ESPHome](https://esphome.io/), so Home Assistant often discovers it automatically.

- **If discovered:** **Settings → Devices & Services** → **ESPHome: 1 device discovered** → **Configure** → **Submit**
- **If not:** **Add Integration** → **ESPHome** → enter the device IP (on screen or web UI) → **Submit**

## Exposed Entities
