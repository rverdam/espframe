# Espframe Firmware Updates

OTA and HTTP updates from GitHub. The device checks a manifest on GitHub Pages for stable and beta builds. The 10-inch model uses `https://jtenniswood.github.io/espframe/firmware/manifest.json` for stable firmware and `https://jtenniswood.github.io/espframe/firmware/beta/manifest.json` for beta firmware. Controls: device web UI at `http://<device-ip>/` under **Firmware** (and in Home Assistant).

During OTA updates, Espframe turns the backlight off before the update starts using a 300ms transition, waits 350ms, then starts the update. If Home Assistant or the screen sleep control had already turned the display off, the screen stays off after the update reboot until it is woken again.

| Status or action | Type | Description |
|------------------|------|-------------|
| **Version** | Text sensor | Installed version |
| **Check for Update** | Button | Check stable (and beta if opted in); does not install |

**Check for Update** only checks for updates; it does not install. To install, use the **Install** button that appears when a stable or pre-release update is available, or turn on **Auto Update** so the device installs at the selected frequency.

Beta Channel must be enabled to check for pre-release firmware. When off, only stable releases are checked — this avoids errors when no pre-release is available.

Advanced users can point the stable or beta manifest URL at another ESP-Web-Tools style manifest. Use a full http:// or https:// URL. Firmware downloads then follow the paths declared by that manifest.
